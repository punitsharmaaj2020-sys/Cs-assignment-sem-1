​# Digital Security: 

The Essentials (Quick Checklist)
​Your computer and accounts are like your house; cyber security is just locking your digital doors. 

​## Top 3 Security Actions
​Do these three things to dramatically increase your protection:
​Turn on MFA/2FA: This is the single best step you can take. It adds a second lock (like your phone) so a stolen password (the key) is useless to hackers.  

● ​Use Unique Passphrases: Never reuse passwords. Use long, unique phrases like "Purple-Elephant-Pizza-99!". Use a Password Manager to help you.  
​Update Everything: Software updates patch "holes" that hackers look for. If it asks to update, click "Yes" immediately. 

​● What to Watch Out For
​Phishing: Fake emails trying to make you panic and click a link. Check the sender's email carefully and hover over links.  
​Malware: Malicious Software that makes your computer sick or steals info.  
​Ransomware: Hackers lock your files and demand money.
